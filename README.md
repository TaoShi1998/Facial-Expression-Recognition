# Facial-Expression-Recognition
## Overview
Human face expression recognition is one of the most powerful and challenging tasks in social communication. In this project, I aim to use Deep Neural Network(DNN) to accurately classify the expressions of face images.

## Related Dataset
I used FER2013 dataset for this project, which includes 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces.
